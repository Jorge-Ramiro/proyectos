About the Department

The TMW Center for Early Learning + Public Health (TMW Center) develops science-based interventions, tools, and technologies to help parents and caregivers interact with young children in ways that maximize brain development. A rich language environment is critical to healthy brain development, however few tools exist to measure the quality or quantity of these environments. Access to this type of data allows caregivers to enhance interactions in real-time and gives policy-makers insight in how to best build policies that have a population-level impact. The ECM team within TMW Center in partnership with Schmidt Futures is building a low-cost wearable device that can reliably and accurately measure a child’s early language environment vis-à-vis the conversational turns between a child and caregiver. The goal is to provide accurate, real-time feedback that empowers parents and caregivers to create the best language environment for their children.


The TMW Center is looking for a Data Science Analyst to support the ECM team in the development of this wearable technology. As a member of the TMW Center’s ECM team, the Data Science Analysts will develop, test, and validate existing machine learning algorithms, train new algorithms, lead ETL efforts, and partner with other team members and vendors to connect the algorithm, hardware and firmware pieces together.
